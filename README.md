## Features

### Capture Experience

In the main Pokémon games from Generation VI and onwards, when a Pokémon is captured, it grants experience to the Pokémon in the player’s party. This mod adds that same logic to the Cobblemon mod. When a player captures a Pokémon, the first Pokémon in their party will be awarded experience as though they had defeated the captured Pokémon in battle.

### Config Options

In the config, the multiplier property is multiplied against the experience received when capturing a Pokémon. For example, if a captured Pokémon would normally grant 250 experience and the multiplier is 2, it would instead grant 500 experience. If the multiplier is 0.5, it would instead grant 125. The multiplier has a default value of 1.
