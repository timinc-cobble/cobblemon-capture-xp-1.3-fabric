## Features

### Capture Experience

In the Pokemon: Let’s Go series, when a Pokemon is captured, it grants experience to the Pokemon in the player’s party. This mod adds that same logic to the Cobblemon mod. When a player captures a Pokemon, the first Pokemon in their party will be awarded experience as though they had defeated the captured Pokemon in battle.

### Config Options

In the config, the multiplier property is multiplied against the experience received when capturing a Pokemon. For example, if a captured Pokemon would normally grant 250 experience and the multiplier is 2, it would instead grant 500 experience. The multiplier has a default value of 1.
